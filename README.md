# Simple-Pearson-Correlation-Coefficient-Calculator
Requires user to key in number of element pairs ie when coordinates are (x=4,y=2) this is one element

Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated by
r = (n(Sum[xy])-((Sum[x])(Sum[y]))/sqrt((n(Sum[x*x])-((Sum[x])(Sum[x])))(n(Sum[y*y])-((Sum[y])(Sum[y]))))

Formula has Six Variables
    Sum[x]
    Sum[y]
    Sum[xy]
    Sum[y*y]
    Sum[x*x]
    n

Key variable is 'n' as it get to determine entries

Sum[element] is a summation of all individual elements of the type(column)
